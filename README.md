## Election-Audit Summary
In regards to the script written to analyze the election data, this script can be used in various different cases if necessary. The script would be very easy to modify to analyze even datasets with more columns of information. For example, if a dataset included the age groups of people voting, we could analyze it to see what age groups had the highest voter turnout rates. We could even combine those results with the results we have about the county voting information to see what the highest turnout rates were for both groups.
This script could also be modified to take in more voter information. We could use it to analyze voting data for the entire country if necessary! The script can be modified very easily to interpret new data or bigger datasets than the one we have now.
